    <h2>Job: Marketing LanguageTool</h2>
    
    <p>The LanguageTool project is looking for a volunteer who takes care of its marketing.
    What would you do? Your task would simply be:</p>

    <p><strong>Make LanguageTool and its add-ons more popular.</strong></p>

    <p>How you do that is up to you. You could blog, improve our website, or create a long-term concept for marketing and 
    then help make it reality. Like the developers, you won't get paid with money but with the chance to be part
    of the team that develops the world's most powerful Open Source style and grammar checker (and a languagetool.org
    email address).</p>
    
    <p>You either have experience in marketing or are eager to learn. You don't start from zero: LanguageTool
    has a few hundred followers on twitter and more than 10,000 visits to its homepage per day. <!--You should be able to
    regularly spend at least two hours per week on it.--> Would you like to take this job? Then please contact
    <a href="mailto:daniel.naber@languagetool-removeme-.org"
       onmouseover="this.href=this.href.replace(/-removeme-/,'');">LanguageTool maintainer Daniel Naber</a>
    with a short introduction of yourself.
